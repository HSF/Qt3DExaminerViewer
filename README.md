# Qt3DExaminerViewer
A viewer module which offers manipulation and visualization functionalities and tools similar to the Open Inventor / Coin Examiner viewer


## How to build

open `Qt3DExaminerViewer.pro` file with QtCreator, click `run` button then it will compile automatically cross platform.

## current functionalities

- info window to show information of volumes and tips
- change visibility for detector volume.
- move the camera forward and backward along radius, equivalent to zoom in and out.
- rotate the camera centered around origin (0,0,0), have the controllability of roll, yaw, pitch.
- restore the original camera viewport by clicking "revert original view".
- switch between perspective and orthographic projection mode for camera.
- switch between select and view mode for mouse:  disable moving camera by mouse after opening "select" mode, disable selecting volume by mouse after opening "view" mode 
- inaccurate picking support: left click volume to select, change its color to red after being selected.
- cancel selection and restore all volumes by click "revert original state", should be replaced by clicking empty space.
- unpacking children support: Cmd/Ctrl + left click to unpack a volume.

- control camera position/direction, mapping relationpship as table below

| input | action |
| - | - |
| Left mouse button | While the left mouse button is pressed, mouse movement along x-axis moves the camera left and right and movement along y-axis moves it up and down.|
| Right mouse button | While the right mouse button is pressed, mouse movement along x-axis pans the camera around the camera view center and movement along y-axis tilts it around the camera view center. |
| Both left and right mouse button | While both the left and the right mouse button are pressed, mouse movement along y-axis zooms the camera in and out without changing the view center. |
| Arrow keys | Move the camera vertically and horizontally relative to camera viewport.|
|Â Page up and page down keys | Move the camera forwards and backwards. |
| Shift key | Changes the behavior of the up and down arrow keys to zoom the camera in and out without changing the view center. The other movement keys are disabled. | 
| Alt key | Changes the behovior of the arrow keys to pan and tilt the camera around the view center. Disables the page up and page down keys.|

## current UI
- before unpacking, here the cylinder represents the world volume

- after unpacking the world and revert original view, Muon and Calorimeter(represented by two cuboids) are shown

- after unpacking the muon and lift the camera(i.e., increase pitch), one child of muon is shown
